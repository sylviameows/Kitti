## What is this?
Kitti is an open-source paper plugin development library used for all my kotlin plugins. It provides kotlin standard library and has useful helper classes for registering brigadier commands with less boilerplate.

### Goals
I don't have much planned for this library yet, but I hope to include some things like:
- Custom Items, Potions, and Enchantments.
- Custom inventory menus.
- Custom book guis.
